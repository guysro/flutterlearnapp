# flutterllearnapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application that shows you the weather.

You can either search a location or get your own.
The home page features an adrress search bar with auto complete powered by the Google Places api, and can get your current location using the lutter Geolocator plugin.

The weather view page has three segments:
Current: the current real temp, feels like temp, sky view and wind speed.
Hourly: the temp and sky view of every hour for the next 24 hours.
Daily: the sky view, minimun and maximun temp of every day for the next week.
